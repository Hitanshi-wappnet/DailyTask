1. Write a Python program to create a set. Go to the editor

2. Write a Python program to iteration over sets. Go to the editor


3. Write a Python program to add member(s) in a set. Go to the edito

4. Write a Python program to remove item(s) from a given set. Go to the editor


5. Write a Python program to remove an item from a set if it is present in the set. Go to the editor



6. Write a Python program to create an intersection of sets. Go to the editor


7. Write a Python program to create a union of sets. Go to the editor


8. Write a Python program to create set difference. Go to the editor


9. Write a Python program to create a symmetric difference. Go to the editor


10. Write a Python program to check if a set is a subset of another set. Go to the editor


11. Write a Python program to create a shallow copy of sets. Go to the editor

Note : Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original object.


12. Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given set. Go to the editor


13. Write a Python program to use of frozensets. Go to the editor
Note: Frozensets behave just like sets except they are immutable.


14. Write a Python program to find maximum and the minimum value in a set. Go to the editor


15. Write a Python program to find the length of a set. Go to the editor


16. Write a Python program to check if a given value is present in a set or not. Go to the editor

17. Write a Python program to check if two given sets have no elements in common. Go to the editor


18. Write a Python program to check if a given set is superset of itself and superset of another given set. Go to the editor


19. Write a Python program to find the elements in a given set that are not in another set. Go to the editor


20. Write a Python program to remove the intersection of a 2nd set from the 1st set. Go to the editor
